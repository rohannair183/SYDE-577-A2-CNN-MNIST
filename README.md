# SYDE-577-A2-CNN-MNIST
Trying to achieve more than 99% test accuracy on MNIST using a convolutional network.

## CNN Model Development Tasks

- [**X**] Create main training script with CNN architecture
- [**X**] Implement baseline CNN model 
- [ ] Add data augmentation (rotation, translation, scaling)
- [ ] Implement training loop with proper validation
- [ ] Add regularization techniques (dropout, batch norm, weight decay)
- [ ] Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters
- [ ] Add requirements.txt for dependencies
- [ ] Create evaluation script to verify 99%+ accuracy
- [ ] Add model checkpointing for best model
- [ ] Document findings and results
